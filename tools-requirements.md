# Daily tracking of water intake

1. Create new menu item in the header called tools
2. Clicking on tools will open a page where all "tools" widgets will be listed
3. For now we will create new tool which will be tracking of daily water intake
    1. User should be able to set daily intake goal (for example 3 litters)
    2. Nice presentation of the current amount of water taken is presented
    3. Option to log water manually
    4. Quick log with predefined values (for example: 250ml, 300ml, 500ml etc.)
    5. The tool should hold historic data
4. The tool should be component based (like a card) that can be reused from other pages as well
